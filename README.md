# Ven519-Ancient-Cities-Mod
Update 0.0.1b (2022/08/10) 
# Added: 
* support for city_center/walls
# Fixed: 
* coloring scheme of city_center/walls
* /locate command
* NAC1-Forge: Nether Ancient Cities would generate in lava at y=0 and fail to cooperate
* NAC2-Files: city_center_3 was left with default scheme
# Needed: 
* NAC3-Forge: Nether Ancient Cities would generate with default sculk patches
* NAC4-Entities: Nether Ancient Cities would generate without being able to summon wardens
* implementation of nether-type-sculk
* deeper nether
* entirety of void city
## NOTE: THIS DOES NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH TelepathicGrunt's Repurposed Structures. I happened to arrive to this idea and am still working on it, might add some other nether variants but thats a nightmare for another time
anyways..... you should still check out the Repurposed Structures TelepathicGrunt has going on (from what I see its pretty nice).
